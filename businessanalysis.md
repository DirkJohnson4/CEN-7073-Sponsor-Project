#5. Preliminary operational concept of proposed system

##5.1 Preliminary operational concept

The new client appointment scheduling system will have features that allow the user to create an account, log in to their account, choose which location they wish to schedule an appointment for, what barbers are available certain days, Available time slots, an ability to book an appointment based on previously mentioned available barbers and available time slots, and an ability to send the appointment to their calander.

###a) operational policies and constraints

Client will only be able to view available time slots and barbers, create an account and log in to said account, and send the booked appointment to their calander.

###b) description of the proposed system

Proposed system will be a simple appointment booking software made to be as user friendly and simple as possible as to not overwhelm the current customer demographic of older less technologically advanceed men.

###c) modes of system operation

The system will me made to operate on web browsers being a website, and on mobile web browsers. 

###d) user classes and other involved personnel

Involved user classes will be: Admin, manager, and customer. Admin will be the developer of the project and have access to everything in the system. Manager will be the manager from the business and they will have the ability to see booked appointments, cancel appointments, and update the schedule on the system. The customer will have the ability to see what time slots are available and with which barbers and be able to book appointments. 

###e) support environment

This system will ideally be supported on web browser (desktop and mobile) and eventually have an app designed.

##5.2 Preliminary operational scenarios

1. Booking an appointment: This process will begin when the manager user class inputs a schedule for when barbers are working. This information is then held in a database and displayed on a calander style interface. The customer user class can then click on days wiothin the calander interface and choose a timeslot based on which barbers are available to book an appointment. This appointment is then stored in a booked appointments database and that time slot is removed from the available time slots database and from the calander interface. 
2. Canceled appointment: The customer wishes to cancel an appointment. They log in and go to their booked appointment. They press a "cancel appointment" option. Thhe booked time slot is then removed from the booked appointments database and put back into the available timeslots database and back on to the calander interface. 
3.  Rescheduled appointments: When a customer would like to reschedule an appointment, they will log in and select a "reschedule appointment" option. This option will bring them to the available timeslots calander interface and allow them to select a new timeslot. Once a new timeslot is selected, the old booked appointment will be removed from the booked appointments database and put back into the available timeslots database and calander interface, while the new appointment is removed from the available time slots database and calander interface and put into the booked appointments database. 

#6. Other preliminary life-cycle concepts

##6.1 Preliminary acquisition concept

The project will be aquired by weekly meetings with the stakeholders, deliverable prototypes at set time intervals, and requirements checks at regular time intervals. 

##6.2 Preliminary deployment concept

The system will planned to be deployed as an application to be downloaded on already existing computer systems in the plces of business. The customer side will be a web browser website and eventually a downloadable mobile application.

##6.3 Preliminary support concept

The system will be supported with regular maintanence, bug fixes, and any adjustments for problems found post launch.

##6.4 Preliminary retirement concept

The system can planned to be retired when the systems it functions on are no longer supported and a new version has to be made.

#7. Project Constraints

The constraints of the project will be mostly the cost. The simplicity of the system will be thae main facotr of keeping costs low and keeping clients happy. The current method of scheduling is good enough to work until this new system is fully developed.
